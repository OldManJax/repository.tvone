# tvOne IPTV

These add-ons are a development of RACC. I have pulled them directly off the Japanese repository and placed them here for easier access and installation. RACC has been providing Kodi IPTV add-ons for many years with many developers forking his work.

After seeing so many older broken versions and forks out there I wanted to provide a location for the original latest updated versions (for Kodi 19 and up). They are slightly modified with an icon, fanart and a date updated tag in the description but the coding that makes them work hasn't been touched. 

Developers are welcome to import this into their own repos to ensure they have the most updated versions.
